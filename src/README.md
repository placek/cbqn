# Overview of the CBQN source

## Conventions

Functions starting with `m_` allocate a new object.  
Functions starting with `q_` are queries/predicates, and return a boolean.  
Functions ending with `R` are either supposed to be called rarely, or the caller expects that a part of it happens rarely.  
Functions ending with `U` return (or take) a non-owned object (`U` = "unincremented").  
Functions ending with `_c1` are monadic implementations, `_c2` are dyadic (see [builtin implementations](#builtin-implementations))
Variables starting with `bi_` are builtins (primitives or special values).  
Which arguments are consumed usually is described in a comment after the function or its prototype. Otherwise, check the source.

## Base

`B` represents any BQN object. Some are heap-allocated, some are not.
```C
Type checks (all are safe to execute on any B instance):
  test       tag       instance description
  isVal(x)   [many]    any heap-allocated object
  isFun(x)   FUN_TAG   a function    (guaranteed heap-allocated)
  isMd1(x)   MD1_TAG   a 1-modifier  (guaranteed heap-allocated)
  isMd2(x)   MD2_TAG   a 2-modifier  (guaranteed heap-allocated)
  isMd (x)   [many]    any modifier  (guaranteed heap-allocated)
  isCallable(x) [many] isFun|isMd    (guaranteed heap-allocated)
  isArr(x)   ARR_TAG   an array type (guaranteed heap-allocated)
  isAtm(x)   [many]    !isArr(x)     can be either heap-allocated or tagged
  isChr(x)   C32_TAG   a character   (never heap-allocated)
  isF64(x)   F64_TAG   a number      (never heap-allocated)
  isNsp(x)   NSP_TAG   a namespace   (guaranteed heap-allocated)
  isObj(x)   OBJ_TAG   internal      (guaranteed heap allocated)
  and then there are some extra types for variables for the VM & whatever; see h.h *_TAG definitions

Extra functions for converting types:
  m_f64(x)  // f64 → B
  m_c32(x)  // codepoint → B
  m_i32(x)  // i32 → B
  m_usz(x)  // usz → B
  o2i(x)    // B → i32, throw if impossible
  o2i64(x)  // B → i64, throw if impossible
  o2u64(x)  // B → u64, throw if impossible
  o2s(x)    // B → usz, throw if impossible
  o2c(x)    // B → c32, throw if impossible
  o2f(x)    // B → f64, throw if impossible
  o2iu(x)   // B → i32, assumes is valid (u ≡ unchecked)
  o2i64u(x) // B → i64, assumes is valid
  o2su(x)   // B → usz, assumes is valid
  o2cu(x)   // B → c32, assumes is valid
  o2fu(x)   // B → f64, assumes is valid
  o2b(x)    // B → bool, throw if impossible
  q_TYPE(x) // query if x is convertible to TYPE (see definitions in h.h)
  q_N(x)    // query if x is · (≡ bi_N)
  noFill(x)    // if x represents undefined fill (returned by getFill*; ≡ bi_noFill)
  tag(x,*_TAG) // pointer → B

See src/h.h for more basic functions
```

An object can be allocated with `mm_alloc(sizeInBytes, t_something)`. The returned object is a `Value*`, but should be used as some subtype. `mm_free` can be used to force-free an object regardless of its reference count.

A heap-allocated object can be cast to a `Value*` with `v(x)`, to an `Arr*` with `a(x)`, or to any pointer type with `c(Type,x)`. `v(x)->type` stores the type of an object (see `enum Type` in `src/h.h`), which is used by runtime functions to decide how to interpret an object.

Reference count of any `B` object can be incremented/decremented with `inc(x)`/`dec(x)` (`inc(x)` also returns `x`, so you can use it inline in the consumer). A pointer type has `ptr_inc(x)`/`ptr_dec(x)`. `dec`/`ptr_dec` will return the object to the memory manager if the refcount goes to zero.

Since reference counting is hard, there's `make heapverify` that verifies that code executed does it right (and screams unreadable messages when it doesn't). After any changes, I'd suggest running:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
make   rtverify && echo   'rtverify:' && ./BQN -M 1000 path/to/mlochbaum/BQN/test/this.bqn
make heapverify && echo 'heapverify:' && ./BQN -M 1000 path/to/mlochbaum/BQN/test/this.bqn -noerr bytecode header identity literal namespace prim simple syntax token under undo
```

Temporary allocations can be made with `utils/talloc.h`:
```C
#include "utils/talloc.h"
TALLOC(char, buf, 123); // allocate char* buf with 123 elements
// buf is now a regular char* and can be stored/passed around as needed
TREALLOC(buf, 456); // extend buf
TFREE(buf); // free buf
// if the size is guaranteed to be small enough, using VLAs is fine i guess

TSALLOC(i32, stack, 10); // allocate an i32 stack with initially reserved 10 items (initial reserve must be positive!)
TSADD(stack, 15); // add a single item
TSADD(stack, (i32*){1,2,3}, 3); // add many items
usz sz = TSSIZE(stack); // get the current height of the stack
i32 item = stack[1]; // get the 2nd item
TSFREE(stack); // free the stack
// note that TSALLOC creates multiple local variables, and as such cannot be passed around to other functions
```

## Virtual functions

All virtual method accesses require that the argument is heap-allocated.

You can get a virtual function of a `B` instance with `TI(x, something)`. There's also `TIv(x, something)` for a pointer `x` instead. See `#define FOR_TI` in `src/h.h` for available functions.

Call a BQN function with `c1(f, x)` or `c2(f, w, x)`. A specific builtin can be called by looking up the appropriate name in `src/builtins.h` (and adding the `bi_` prefix).

Calling a modifier involves deriving it with `m1_d`/`m2_d`, using a regular `c1`/`c2`, and managing the refcounts of everything while at that.

## Builtin implementations

The list of builtin functions is specified in the initial macros of `src/builtins.h`, where `A`/`M`/`D` are used for ambivalent/monadic/dyadic. Once added, `bi_yourName` will be available, and the required of the following functions must be defined somewhere in the source:

```C
// functions:
B yourName_c1(B t, B x);
B yourName_c2(B t, B w, B x);
// 1-modifiers:
B yourName_c1(Md1D* d, B x);
B yourName_c2(Md1D* d, B w, B x);
// 2-modifiers:
B yourName_c1(Md2D* d, B x);
B yourName_c2(Md2D* d, B w, B x);
```

For functions, in most cases, the `t` parameter (representing `𝕊`/"this") is unused (it _must_ be ignored for functions managed by `builtins.h`), but can be used for objects from `nfns.h` to store state with a function.

For modifiers, the `d` parameter stores the operands and the modifier itself. Use `d->f` for `𝔽`, `d->g` for `𝔾`, `d->m1` for `_𝕣`, `d->m2` for `_𝕣_`, and `tag(d,FUN_TAG)` for `𝕊`.


## Arrays

If you know that `x` is an array (e.g. by testing `isArr(x)` beforehand), `a(x)->ia` will give you the product of the shape, `rnk(x)` will give you the rank, and `a(x)->sh` will give you a `usz*` to the full shape.

Allocating an array:
```C
i32* rp; B r = m_i32arrv(&rp, 123); // allocate a 123-element i32 vector
i32* rp; B r = m_i32arrc(&rp, x); // allocate an array with the same shape as x (x must be an array; x isn't consumed)

i32* rp; Arr* r = m_i32arrp(&rp, 123); // allocate a 123-element i32-array without allocating shape
// then do one of these:
arr_shVec(r); // set shape of r to a vector
usz* sh = arr_shAlloc(r, 4); // allocate a rank 4 shape; write to sh the individual items; sh will be NULL for ranks 0 and 1
arr_shCopy(r, x); // copy the shape object of x (doesn't consume x)
B result = taga(r);
// see stuff.h for m_shArr/arr_shSetI/arr_shSetU for ways to batch-assign a single shape object to multiple objects

u32* rp; B r = m_c32arrv(%rp, 10); // 10-char string
// etc for m_(i8|i16|i32|c8|c16|c32|f64)arr[vcp]

usz ri=0; HArr_p r = m_harrs(123, &ri); // allocate 123-item arbitrary type array
// write items with r.a[ri++] or equivalent. Whenever GC could happen, ri must point to after the end of the currently set items
// then do one of these to finish the array:
B result = harr_fv(r); // sets shape to a vector
B result = harr_fc(r, x); // copies the shape of x, doesn't consume x
B result = harr_fcd(r, x); // copies the shape of x and consumes it
usz* sh = harr_fa(r, 4); // allocate shape for a rank 4 array. To get the result `B` object, just do r.b
// If at any point you want to free the object before finishing it, use harr_abandon(r)

// If you're sure GC cannot happen before all items in the array are set, you can use: (U means "unsafe")
HArr_p r = m_harrUv(10); // 10-item vector
HArr_p r = m_harrUc(10, x); // 10-item array with the same shape as x
HArr_p r = m_harrUp(10); // 10-item array without any set shape. Use the arr_shWhatever(r.c, …)

// you can use withFill to add a fill element to a created array (or manually create a fillarr, see src/core/fillarr.h)

B r = m_str32(U"⟨1⋄2⋄3⟩"); // a constant string with unicode chars
B r = m_str8(5, "hello"); // an ASCII string with specified length
B r = m_str8l("hello"); // an ASCII string, read until null byte
#include "utils/utf.h"
B r = fromUTF8l("⟨1⋄2⋄3⟩") // parse UTF-8 from a char*
B r = fromUTF8("⟨1⋄2⋄3⟩", 17) // ↑ but with a specified length
u64 sz = utf8lenB(x); TALLOC(char, buf, sz+1); toUTF8(x, buf); buf[sz]=0; /*use buf as a C-string*/ TFREE(buf);

// src/utils/mut.h provides a way to build an array by copying parts of other arrays

// some functions for specific cases:
B r = m_unit(x); // equivalent to <𝕩
B r = m_hunit(x); // like the above, except no fill is set
B r = m_atomUnit(x); // if x is likely to be an atom, this is a better alternative to m_unit
B r = m_v1(a); // ⟨a⟩
B r = m_v2(a,b); // ⟨a,b⟩
B r = m_v3(a,b,c); // ⟨a,b,c⟩
B r = m_v4(a,b,c,d); // ⟨a,b,c,d⟩
B r = emptyHVec(); // an empty vector with no fill
B r = emptyIVec(); // an empty integer vector
B r = emptyCVec(); // an empty character vector
B r = emptySVec(); // an empty string vector
// rank can be manually set for an exsiting object with sprnk or srnk, but be careful to keep the shape object in sync!
```


Retrieving data from arrays:
```C
// generic methods:
SGet(x) // initializes the getter for fast reads; the argument must be a variable name
B c = Get(x,n); // in a loop, reating the n-th item

SGetU(x)
B c = GetU(x,n); // alternatively, GetU can be used to not increment the result. Useful for temporary usage of the item

B c = IGet(x,n); // skip the initialize/call separation; don't use in loops
B c = IGetU(x,n);

// for specific array types:
if (TI(x,elType)==el_i32) i32* xp = i32any_ptr(x); // for either t_i32arr or t_i32slice; for t_i32arr only, there's i32arr_ptr(x)
if (TI(x,elType)==el_c32) u32* xp = c32any_ptr(x); // ↑
if (TI(x,elType)==el_f64) f64* xp = f64any_ptr(x); // ↑
if (v(x)->type==t_harr) B* xp = harr_ptr(x);
if (v(x)->type==t_harr || v(x)->type==t_hslice) B* xp = hany_ptr(x); // note that elType==el_B doesn't imply hany_ptr is safe!
if (v(x)->type==t_fillarr) B* xp = fillarr_ptr(x);
B* xp = arr_bptr(x); // will return NULL if the array isn't backed by contiguous B*-s
```

## Errors

Throw an error with `thrM("some message")` or `thr(some B instance)` or `thrOOM()`. What to do with active references at the time of the error is TBD when GC is actually completed, but you can just not worry about that for now.

A fancier message can be created with `thrF(message, …)` with printf-like (but different!!) varargs (source in `do_fmt`):
```
%i   decimal i32 (also for i8/i16/ur)
%l   decimal i64
%ui  decimal u32 (also for u8/u16)
%ul  decimal u64
%xi  hex u32
%xl  hex u64
%s   decimal usz
%f   f64
%p   pointer
%c   char
%S   char* C-string consisting of ASCII
%U   char* of UTF-8 data
%R   a B instance of a string or number
%H   the shape of a B instance
%%   "%"
```
See `#define CATCH` in `src/h.h` for how to catch errors.

Use `assert(predicate)` for checks (for optimized builds they're replaced with `if (!predicate) invoke_undefined_behavior();` so it's still invoked!!). `UD;` can be used to explicitly invoke undefined behavior (equivalent in behavior to `assert(false);`), which is useful for things like untaken `default` branches in `switch` statements.

There's also `err("message")` that (at least currently) is kept in optimized builds as-is, and always kills the process on being called.
